      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Kiley. I'm a senior front-end engineer and I've been building
        web applications and delivering software projects since 2011. In that
        time, I've designed and built over 15 SaaS, web, and mobile
        applications, from recruiting software to healthcare products to
        subscription-based services. I'm engaged most when I get to work with a
        close-knit team building products that people use to solve important
        problems, while ensuring the code we write is secure, maintainable,
        performant, easy to read, and easy to delete (when the time comes, as it
        always does).
      </p>

      <p>Over the years, I have built a deep expertise in the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (of course!)</li>
        <li>
          Building production-grade web applications with React, TypeScript, and
          Next.js
        </li>
        <li>Building and using REST and GraphQL APIs</li>
        <li>
          Full-stack, cloud-based applications using Node.js, TypeScript, and
          serverless architectures
        </li>
        <li>Database design, especially PostgreSQL and DynamoDB (NoSQL)</li>
        <li>User Experience (UX) design, from user journeys to wireframes</li>
        <li>
          User Interface (UI) design, from hand-drawn sketches to Figma
          prototypes
        </li>
        <li>
          Product strategy, from shaping individual features to 3-year roadmaps
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        But more important than the code, I care deeply about helping
        early-career developers through pair programming, mentoring, tech talks,
        and community building. I've held leadership positions including
        technical team lead, engineering manager of both junior and senior
        engineers, product lead, and a mentor for 6 engineers (and counting!).
      </p>

      <h2>Career Highlights</h2>

      <p>
        I've had the opportunity to work on some big and complex projects over
        the years, as well as some brand new build-from-scratch startups. Here
        are a few highlights that stand out:
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at AWS</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was the tech lead for a multi-million dollar engagement building
            ML-powered data forecasting tools for the Amazon packaging
            innovation organization. I led a team of 5-6 engineers and cloud
            application architects.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built 2 full-stack, consumer-facing SaaS products for a Fortune
            500 tire company using Next.js and Amplify.
          </li>
          <li>
            I worked on a project with a multi-lingual team called "Gas Stations
            of the Future" for the largest energy company in Argentina, and I
            built a back-office web-based tool that ran locally in the gas
            stations (to be resilient to internet outages).
          </li>
          <li>
            Working on an AWS service team, I made tooling improvements that
            reduced our monorepo build time by 28%, resulting in saving 80
            engineers about 40 seconds per build. 40 seconds seems small, but
            with 80 engineers running 3-4 builds per day, it equates to almost 3
            hours of engineering time saved per day.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time as CTO of DentalPost</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            DentalPost is a job board software company based in Atlanta where I
            led the 4-person engineering team as the CTO.
          </li>
          <li>
            I led a project to ship a rebuild of the product from Java Server
            Pages to a Java REST API with a React front end.
          </li>
          <li>
            I shifted engineering from scrum 2-week sprints to 6-week cycles
            using the "Shape Up" method. I designed and pitched product features
            to the CEO, managed the team to deliver them, and wrote a good
            portion of the front end code as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            The product management changes I implemented helped the team ship
            monthly releases of a half-dozen long-awaited, big features.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at SOLTECH</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SOLTECH is a ~50-person software consulting firm based in Atlanta,
            GA.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built a React Native front end of an iPad application that was
            used by doctors with patients who speak a different language. The
            app connected a live translator via video chat to translate between
            patient and doctor in realtime.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at TORQworks</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            TORQworks is a software company that helps long-term unemlpoyed
            individuals find new careers and jobs. It was acquired in 2018-2019.
          </li>
          <li>
            I acted as the only front-end developer, UX designer, and UI
            designer. I redesigned what was an outdated web application using
            the (then) modern visual design system from Google called Material
            Design.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built the front-end of the new version using AngularJS, working
            closely with and learning a great deal from the CTO who was a former
            Microsoft software engineer (forever grateful for your mentorship
            and faith in me, JM!).

        </ul>

      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at ACT Bridge</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In my first job out of college, I worked at ACT Bridge, an HR
            technology startup funded by ACT (the college testing company). I
            started as the team's one-and-only "tech person" and handled
            everything from setting up the company website to buying team
            laptops to analyzing data in Excel and Tableau.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eventually, I became the tech product lead as the company
            transformed from a pure consulting to a SaaS-based technology
            business.
          </li>
          <li>
            I envisioned and designed the SaaS product, called TRUE Talent, and
            oversaw its development. I helped launch it at a major healthcare
            provider.
