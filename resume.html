      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Kiley. I'm a senior front-end engineer and I've been building
        web applications and delivering software projects since 2011. I'm
        engaged most when I get to work with a close-knit team building products
        that people use to solve important problems. I focus on building
        software that clearly solves a user's job-to-be-done while being secure,
        maintainable, performant, and easy to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical specialty as a front-end developer includes a deep
        expertise in the usual suspects like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've
        built numerous production-grade, thick-client web applications using
        React, TypeScript, and APIs with both GraphQL and REST. Outside of front
        end, I've led efforts in cloud application development, API development,
        database design, user experience design, product design, and product
        strategy. I've also held several roles as a technical team lead, leading
        teams of both junior and senior engineers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care deeply about helping early-career developers through pair
        programming, mentoring, tech talks, and community building.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        I've designed and built over 15 SaaS applications over the past decade,
        from recruiting software to healthcare products to subscription-based
        services. A few highlights:
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at AWS</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was the tech lead for a multi-million dollar engagement building
            ML-powered data forecasting tools for the Amazon packaging
            innovation organization. I led a team of 5-6 engineers and cloud
            application architects.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built 2 full-stack, consumer-facing SaaS products for a Fortune
            500 tire company using Next.js and Amplify.
          </li>
          <li>
            I worked on a project with a multi-lingual team called "Gas Stations
            of the Future" for the largest energy company in Argentina, and I
            built a back-office web-based tool that ran locally in the gas
            stations (to be resilient to internet outages).
          </li>
          <li>
            Working on an AWS service team, I made tooling improvements that
            reduced our monorepo build time by 28%, resulting in saving 80
            engineers about 40 seconds per build. 40 seconds seems small, but
            with 80 engineers running 3-4 builds per day, it equates to almost 3
            hours of engineering time saved per day.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time as CTO of DentalPost</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            DentalPost is a job board software company based in Atlanta, with
            $3-4M in annual revenue while I was there (it was recently
            acquired). I led the 4-person engineering team as the CTO.
          </li>
          <li>
            I led a project to ship a rebuild of the product from Java Server
            Pages to a Java REST API with a React front end.
          </li>
          <li>
            I shifted engineering from scrum 2-week sprints to 6-week cycles
            using the "Shape Up" method. I designed and pitched product features
            to the CEO, managed the team to deliver them, and wrote a good
            portion of the front end code as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            The product management changes I implemented helped the team ship
            monthly releases of a half-dozen long-awaited, big features.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at SOLTECH</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            SOLTECH is a ~50-person software consulting firm based in Atlanta,
            GA.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built a React Native front end of an iPad application that was
            used by doctors with patients who speak a different language. The
            app connected a live translator via video chat to translate between
            patient and doctor in realtime.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at TORQworks</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            TORQworks is a software company that helps long-term unemlpoyed
            individuals find new careers and jobs. It was acquired in 2018-2019.
          </li>
          <li>
            I acted as the only front-end developer, UX designer, and UI
            designer. I redesigned what was an outdated web application using
            the (then) modern visual design system from Google called Material
            Design.
          </li>
          <li>
            I built the front-end of the new version using AngularJS, working
            closely with and learning a great deal from the CTO who was a former
            Microsoft software engineer (forever grateful for your mentorship
            and faith in me, JM!).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Highlights from my time at ACT Bridge</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In my first job out of college, I worked at ACT Bridge, an HR
            technology startup funded by ACT (the college testing company). I
            started as the team's one-and-only "tech person" and handled
            everything from setting up the company website to buying team
            laptops to analyzing data in Excel and Tableau.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eventually, I became the tech product lead as the company
            transformed from a pure consulting to a SaaS-based technology
            business.
          </li>
          <li>
            I envisioned and designed the SaaS product, called TRUE Talent, and
            oversaw its development. I helped launch it at a major healthcare
            provider.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>
