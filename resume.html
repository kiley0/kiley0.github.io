      <h1>Kiley Dorton</h1>
      <p>
        Senior Software Engineer, Front End at Slack<br />
        Based in Atlanta, GA | Prefer remote

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Kiley is a senior front-end engineer with 11 years of professional
        experience building web applications and delivering software projects.
        He is engaged most when building products and services that help people
        work on solving important problems, are rewarding to build as a team,
        and are built with a focus on the user experience, security,
        maintainability, and performance. His technical specialties include
        React, JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, REST APIs, cloud application
        development, user experience design, product design, product strategy,
        and technical team leadership.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kiley has designed and built many SaaS applications over the past 10
        years, from recruiting software to healthcare products to
        subscription-based services. He led the engineering team at a $4M
        software company as the CTO, and shipped a rebuild of the product
        followed by monthly releases of many long-awaited features. At AWS, he
        built consumer-facing SaaS products for a Fortune 500 tire company,
        back-office applications for the largest energy company in Argentina,
        and data forecasting tools for internal Amazon packaging innovation
        teams. In the fall of 2022, he joined an AWS service team as the first
        front-end engineer, helping to design and build a new service from
        scratch. He cares deeply about helping early-career developers through
        pair programming, mentoring, tech talks, and community building.
