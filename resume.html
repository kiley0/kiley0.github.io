      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Kiley. I'm a senior front-end engineer and I've been building
        web applications and delivering software projects since 2011. I'm
        engaged most when I get to work with a close-knit team building products
        that people use to solve important problems. I focus on building
        software that clearly solves a user's job-to-be-done while being secure,
        maintainable, performant, and easy to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical specialty as a front-end developer includes a deep
        expertise in the usual suspects like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've
        built numerous production-grade, thick-client web applications using
        React, TypeScript, and APIs with both GraphQL and REST. Outside of front
        end, I've led efforts in cloud application development, API development,
        database design, user experience design, product design, and product
        strategy. I've also held several roles as a technical team lead, leading
        teams of both junior and senior engineers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care deeply about helping early-career developers through pair
        programming, mentoring, tech talks, and community building.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        I've designed and built over 15 SaaS applications over the past decade,
        from recruiting software to healthcare products to subscription-based
        services. A few highlights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At AWS, working in the ProServe Application Development division, I
          built 2 full-stack, consumer-facing SaaS products for a Fortune 500
          tire company; worked on a project with a multi-lingual team called
          "Gas Stations of the Future" for the largest energy company in
          Argentina; and was the tech lead for a multi-million dollar engagement
          building ML-powered data forecasting tools for the Amazon packaging
          innovation organization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Later at AWS, working on an AWS service team, I made tooling
          improvements that reduced our monorepo build time by 28%, resulting in
          saving 80 engineers about 40 seconds per build. 40 seconds seems
          small, but with 80 engineers running 3-4 builds per day, it equates to
          almost 3 hours of engineering time saved per day.
        </li>
        <li>
          At DentalPost, a job board software company based in Atlanta with $4M
          in annual revenue, I led the 4-person engineering team as the CTO,
          shipped a rebuild of the product from Java Server Pages to a Java REST
          API with a React front end, shifted engineering from scrum 2-week
          sprints to 6-week cycles using the "Shape Up" method, and helped the
          team ship monthly releases of a half-dozen long-awaited, big features.
        </li>
        <li>
          At SOLTECH, a ~50-person software consulting firm based, I built a
          React Native front end of an iPad application that was used by doctors
          with patients who speak a different language. The app connected a live
          translator via video chat to translate between patient and doctor in
          realtime.
        </li>
        <li>
          At TORQworks, a software company that helped long-term unemlpoyed
          individuals find new careers and jobs, I acted as the only front-end
          developer, UX designer, and UI designer. I redesigned what was an
          outdated web application using the (then) modern visual design system
          from Google called Material Design. I built the front-end of the new
          version using AngularJS, working closely with and learning a great
          deal from the CTO who was a former Microsoft software engineer
          (forever grateful for your mentorship and faith in me, JM!).
        </li>
        <li>
          In my first job out of college, I worked at ACT Bridge, an HR
          technology startup funded by ACT (the college testing company). I
          started as the team's one-and-only "tech person" but eventually became
          the product lead as the company transformed from a pure consulting to
          a technology SaaS business. I envisioned and designed the SaaS
          product, oversaw its development, and launched it at a major
          healthcare provider.
        </li>
      </ul>
