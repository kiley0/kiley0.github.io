        Hi, I'm Kiley. I started my career in 2011 working at a startup in
        Atlanta, and I've been a full-time web developer since 2013. I
        specialize in React, TypeScript, and all things front end. Currently I
        work at Slack as a Senior Software Engineer, Front End. Previously, I
        worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a Senior Front End Engineer.
